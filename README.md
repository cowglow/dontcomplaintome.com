A disappointing feedback tool. Not for the faint-hearted, tough skin required.

If you feel like filing a complaint, feel free to use out automated feedback. You can always appeal a decision to speak with a person. Visit [https://dontcomplaintome.com/](https://dontcomplaintome.com/) and fill your complaint. Remember to screenshot your complaint in the form prior to submitting it! 


## Introduction
"Don't Complain To Me" is a simple feedback tool that generates humorous responses to complaints. 
The tool was developed with the aim of providing a unique and fun way for people to deal with complaints.

## How it Works
When a user enters a complaint into the text area and submits it, the tool generates a random humorous response from a 
predefined list of responses. The response is then displayed on the page in place of the text area, along with a "Make a
new complaint" button that refreshes the page and allows the user to enter a new complaint.

## Usage
To use the tool, simply navigate to https://dontcomplaintome.com and enter your complaint into the text area. Click the 
"Submit" button and wait for the response. If you're not satisfied with the response, you can always make a new 
complaint by clicking the "Make a new complaint" button.

Please note that the responses generated by this tool are meant to be humorous and not intended to be taken seriously. 
The responses were generated from a predefined list of responses and do not reflect the views or opinions of the 
developer of this tool.

## Technical Details
The tool is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The responses are stored in a JSON file, which is queried 
using JavaScript's fetch() method. In the future it would be nice to introduce some language model which better 
interprets the user's complaint.
